# Ray-Casting-
 # Controls-
  W: Move forward
  S: Move backward
  A: Turn left
  D: Turn right
  E: Open doors(You must first pick up the red key)
  Spacebar: Shoot 
 # Objective-
  Reach the exit door after defeating the enemy ("Orb King") to win.
 # Description-
  3D raycasting-based game written in C using OpenGL (GLUT), similar to classic DOOM-style rendering. 
  # Map-
   Defined as 9x9 grid arrays:

   mapW: Wall texture map (1-6 are walls/doors).
   mapF: Floor texture map.
   mapC: Ceiling texture map.
  # Player-  
  float px, py;      // player position
  float pdx, pdy;    // direction vector
  float pa;          // angle the player is facing

  # Bullet System-
   Each bullet is stored in a bullet struct:
   
   typedef struct
   {
    int active;         //bullet is active/inactive
    float x,y;          //bullet position
    float dx,dy;        //bullet direction
    float speed;        //bullet speed
    int life;           //bullet lifetime
   }bullet; 
   
   Max 10 bullets.
   shootBullet() spawns one.
   updateBullets() moves and checks collisions with walls and enemy.
   
  # Sprites (Objects in the game world)-
   typedef struct      //All veriables per sprite
   {
    int type;          //static, key, enemy
    int state;         //on off
    int map;           //texture to show
    float x,y,z;       //position
    int hp;
   }sprite;
   
   3 types:
     type=1: key
     type=2: lights
     type=3: enemy (Orb King)
     
     The enemy (sp[2][0]) moves toward the player when alive.
     It moves faster when the player is not looking at it.
     If enemy collides with player â†’ game over (state 4).
   
  # Doors-
   Can only open if key is picked up (proximity-based).
   mapW[index] = 4 denotes a door tile.
   If mapW[index] == 4 && key collected, door opens and showBossBar = 1.
  # Rendering-
   # drawRays2D()
    Raycasting algorithm:
     Shoots 120 rays in FOV from player's POV.
     Finds nearest wall intersection per ray.
     Handles fish-eye correction.
   
   # Calculates:
    Wall shading
    Floor/ceiling textures
    Depth buffer for sprite rendering
   
   # drawSprite()
    Key
    Lights
    Enemy
    Based on player's rotation and depth.
   
   # drawBullets()
    Draws yellow circles representing bullets in 3D space.
   
   # drawSky()
    A static background skybox based on pa (player angle).
   
   # drawBossHealthBar()
    Shows a red health bar for the boss (enemy) at the top-center.
   
  # Screens-
   screen(v)
    v == 1: Title screen
    v == 2: Win screen
    v == 3: Lose screen
   All fade in using the fade variable.
   
  # Game States-
   int gameState = 0;
    0 = init
    1 = title screen
    2 = game loop
    3 = win screen
    4 = lose screen
    
  # Main Loop- display()
   Handles the entire game frame by frame:
    Movement, rotation.
    Bullet update.
    Drawing sky, walls, sprites.
    Game progression and state handling.
    
  # Entry Point- main()
   Initializes the GLUT window, sets up callbacks:
   display(): frame rendering
   ButtonDown(), ButtonUp(): input handling
   resize(): window resize handling
  
  # Textures-
   Included from:
    #include "../Textures/All_Textures.ppm"
    #include "../Textures/sky.ppm"
    #include "../Textures/title.ppm"
    #include "../Textures/won.ppm"
    #include "../Textures/lost.ppm"
    #include "../Textures/sprites.ppm"   
   All textures are expected to be raw .ppm images.
